# Planning Directory

Most planning documents have been moved to `_archived_legacy/`.

## Active Documentation

Active architecture and requirements documentation can be found in:
- `/docs/` - Main documentation directory with PRD, design docs, and guides

## Why Archived?

The original planning documents (00-07_*.md) described a Python/Streamlit/FastAPI architecture
that was deprecated when the project pivoted to Next.js + Supabase.

Current technical architecture is documented in `/docs/`:
- `FARchat_Product_Requirements_Document.md`
- `BACKEND_SETUP.md`
- `COMPREHENSIVE_UX_AUDIT_2025.md`
- And other active documentation
